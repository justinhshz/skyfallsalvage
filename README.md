## üéÆ Gameplay Overview

In a dystopian future, the wealthy live in a majestic floating city known as Celestium, while the poor struggle to survive on the ground below. You are an engineer salvaging discarded components from above, merging and upgrading them to survive‚Äîand possibly rebel.

**Core Mechanics:**

* üß¨ **Falling Elements**\
  Elements fall from the top of the screen. When two identical elements collide, they merge into a higher-level element. Only the first few low-tier elements will fall. Higher-level elements must be obtained by merging‚Äîthey will never drop directly.

* üß∑ **Connectors System**\
  Occasionally, connectors fall. When they contact **two specific types of different elements**, they combine to form a **equipment**.

* ‚è±Ô∏è **Controlled Drop Timing**\
  Elements and connectors move back and forth horizontally across the screen while a countdown timer runs. The player must **click** or press **spacebar** before the timer expires to decide when and where to drop the item. If no input is given in time, the item will automatically fall at its current position.

* ‚ö° **Activating Equipments**\
  Equipments are crafted during gameplay but remain inactive until your score reaches their activation threshold. Once unlocked, you can trigger them at any time for powerful effects like instant upgrades or element conversions.

* üéØ **Skill Selection**\
  Skills are offered at regular score intervals, allowing you to choose effects like score multipliers for merges or extended countdown time before auto-drop. These choices shape each run and add variety to the roguelike experience.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Game Over & Rankings**\
  The game ends when items stack beyond the designated boundary line near the top of the field. Players must manage space carefully to avoid reaching this critical limit. After the game ends, your score is recorded and compared on a leaderboard, adding a competitive element to each run.

* **No additional keyboard input required.**

## üß© Item Overview

There are three core item types‚Äî**Elements**, **Connectors**, and **Equipments**‚Äîeach with distinct mechanics and clear visual hierarchy. Below is an overview to help you quickly identify and understand the role of each category.

### üß¨ Elements

Elements are the fundamental items that fall from above. When two identical elements collide, they merge into a higher-level element. Only lower-tier elements drop; advanced levels must be achieved through merging.

### üß∑ Connectors

Connectors are special items that trigger crafting when they contact two specific, compatible elements. They do not merge with other connectors and only appear occasionally.

  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="Assets/Development/Sprites/Entities/Connectors/%5BConnector%5D%20Level%201.png"

        <strong>
          Lv.2
        </strong>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### ‚ö° Equipments

Equipments are the result of successful combinations involving a connector and two matching elements. They provide powerful effects but can only be activated once your score reaches the required threshold.
